      <p class="blogcontent">It was hard for me to think of a recent emotional conflict I had with someone for this exercise. I think the most relevant experience I had was with my boss at a real estate investment firm I use to work for. There was a time where we had hired an outside accounting firm to do our numbers because we were a small shop with not too many resources. Things went sour with the accounting firm as they started charging us exorbitant amounts for small errors they found in our accounting software, charging us a high rate per hour. When we first signed up with the firm about 2 months prior, it seemed too good to be true. They were going to completely prepare the financials for monthly reporting, but we did not anticipate how much extra they would charge.</p>
      <p class="blogcontent">
      Because this was my boss' startup company he was very invested, not just financially. He took every problem with the company to heart, maybe even too much, allowing himself to get overwhelmed with emotion when anything bad happened. This situation was no exception. When he saw the high charges, he lost it. He immediately called the accounting firm and proceeded to yell and curse them out for about a half hour. Whenever something like this would happen, it would change my bossâ€™s mood towards everyone for the whole day. I knew he wasn't mad at us, but rather the situation.</p>
      <p class="blogcontent">
      As soon as he hung up the phone and left the office, I called the accounting firm to sort things out. I spoke to them in a calm manner, apologized for what my boss had said but he did have reason to be upset. We went through each charge, one by one, of which I then explained later to my boss. After the call, the accountants thanked me for being sensible and hearing them out. It was kind of like the good cop, bad cop routine but it worked. It all worked out in the end but we did end up parting ways with that accounting firm. Going back I would not have handled anything differently. I knew my boss had a tendency to get hotheaded, so when it happened it was not surprising. I took it as a chance for me to respond positively and resolve the situation so all parties were pleased.</p>
