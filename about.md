I grew up in Wilmington, Delaware, just outside of Philadelphia. I went to the same school for thirteen years from Kindergarden through high school. My class was only 58 kids and about half of them were there just as long as I was. I decided I wanted a change when it came to college and went to a bigger school all the way on the west coast, the University of Southern California. After working in Real Estate in LA for a few years, I desired something more creative. I decided it was time for a change and decided to move to Austin to pursue a career in web development.
