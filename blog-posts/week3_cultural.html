  <h2 id="blogtitle">My Gregorc Thinking Style</h2>
<p class="blogcontent">So according to the gregorc thinking style quiz, I am pretty evenly spread out. However, the two styles that were slightly higher than the rest were concrete random and abstract random. After reading into these a little bit, I would say that I demonstrate qualities of both. Concrete random thinkings like to take risks, experiment to find answers, and use their intuition to solve problems independently. This really struck with me because it reminded me of how I have been studying web development so far. I really did go off on my own by even getting into web development. Up until DBC, I was teaching myself independently, working through problems by myself. Abstract random thinkers like to listen to others, bring harmony to group situations, establish healthy relationships, and focus on issues at hand. This reminded me more of how I deal with personal and family relationships. I am usually the one who tries to create peace within the family and help others develop by supporting them. I prefer to focus on issues at hand, rather than ponder on what could happen in the future.</p>
<p class="blogcontent">What is hard for me as a concrete random thinker is routines, restrictions and limiations, re-doing things, and keeping records. I laughed as I read these descriptions off the Gregorc website because I litteraly had to redo the Gregorc quiz to complete this assignment. That really bothered me because it was something I had done before but I could not find the record of my results. I think the biggest obstacle I have come into with DBC so far, regarding this thinking style, has been the reports we have to do. There is a lot of work for DBC, not just coding, but reporting and reflecting. Sometimes I feel like this is just a hassle, and why can't I just code, but as soon as I do it I usually see it was valuable. DBC has been pretty open in terms of restrictions and limitations so I really can't complain there. The other thinking style I fell under, Abstract Random, find it hard to work with people who don't seem friendly, concentrating on one thing at a time, having to explain their feelings. I thought of my most recent work experience at Tesla Motors when working with people who don't seem friendly. One of my managers was not the nicest guys in the world and would frequently make sarcastic remarks at me that I thought were a little over the top. I know he was probably just joking but it did not come across that way. It really bothered me and prevented me from having a good relationship with him. Don't get me wrong, I can be very sarcastic but I usually do not use my sarcasm to direct at peoples personal traits. Growing up my parents would always tell me I did not explain my feelings to them. I had a hard time verbalzing how I felt, but I must say I have really changed in the last few years. I have worked hard to be mindful of how I am feeling and react after I have noticed my feelings. I think the abstract random side in me will work well at DBC because I am in a friendly environment in which I will be able to participate in group acitivties amoung my fellow Boots!</p>
