  <h2 id="blogtitle">JavaScript is for cool kids...</h2>
<p class="blogcontent">Why is JavaScript popular in web development? Javascript initally became popular because it was made for Netscape Navigator, which was the dominate browser at the time it was introduced in 1994. Netscape wanted to introduce a competitor to Java and some say the rode off the popularity of Java by naming their language JavaScript. These two are very different though despite the similar name. Microsoft picked up JS in 1996 by adding it to their browser, Internet Explorer. Javascript has continuted to be iterated on with the third edition in 1999, fourth in 2009, and the fifth in 2011. It is now one of the most popular languages on the web. Programmers were initially skeptical because they thought it was a language for amateurs. However, with continued development and the addition of AJAX, JS has continued to be a prominant language on the web.</p>
<p class="blogcontent">What is so great about JS? JavaScript is great because it is an object-oriented language very similar to C. It is relatively easy to learn and edit compared to other languages. There are a wide range of tools and libraries availible for JS because of its popularity. It is also easy to debug in the console and can work well with the server side data using AJAX.</p>
<p class="blogcontent">What are the limitations? Javascript received a bad reputation initially because it was pretty buggy and is what is called a "loosely typed" language. This means it allows the programmer to not use perfect syntax and it will still run the program. Programs could have bugs, but they still run! This could lead to bad programming practices as you do not always know when you are writing sloppy code. </p>
