  <h2 id="blogtitle">Diversity in Tech</h2>
<p class="blogcontent">Diversity has always been a huge issue in the tech industry. The industry today is primarily male, and primarily white. It seems even the companies at the top are huge culprits of this stereotype. Some seven out of every 10 employees at Twitter are men. Similar statistics are shown below for many of the top companies in the industry, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>

<p class="blogcontent">The data here suggests that after Whites,  and Asians make up a huge part of tech industry (ranging from 30% - 40%). Despite the amount of Asians in the industry, there is still a huge gap between those in executive positions and those that grind it out to make these companies function.  For example, at Facebook Asians make up a third of the workforce, but only represent 19 percent of the senior level positions. According to reports, Asians make up about 4 out of every 10 engineers.  Some suggest the idea of a “Bamboo Ceiling” that says Asians cannot get past a predetermined point in the tech industry, citing the way some Asian children are raised to respect authority and avoid conflict. If this is true, could these traits inhibit Asians from leading others?</p>
<p class="blogcontent">There is a huge gap in the amount of Black/Hispanics vs Asians/Whites as well. At most of these companies the percentage of Hispanic and Black employees is usually around 6%, combined! Companies continue to say they need to do a better job of reaching out to in recruiting black and Hispanic technologists. However, real progress here remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="blogcontent">Why should we care about diversity? </br> This world is made up of many different types of people, and it appears the tech industry does not really reflect that. Maybe it is true that the nature of programming aligns more with a certain type of person, but that should have nothing to do with race.  Companies generally say they need to do a better job reaching out to the Hispanic and African-American demographic but it does not appear as though much is being done. Perhaps in time we will see more and more come into the industry as it increases in popularity and becomes more accessible. This is important because as Google once said in their own reporting,  'Having a diversity of perspectives leads to better decision-making, more relevant products, and makes work a whole lot more interesting'
