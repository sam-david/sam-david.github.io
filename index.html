      <p class="skill-text">HTML and CSS were some of the first development subjects I studied, as expected. I began teaching myself online, mainly through Lynda.com, but desired to return to a classroom environment. Before I applied to a full stack immersive class, I attended a front-end part-time course in Austin, TX at Makersquare. This was great initial exposure to HTML, CSS, Javascript, and CSS frameworks like Zurb Foundation to build responsive environments.</p>

      <h2 class="skill-heading">Ruby | JavaScript</h2>
      <p class="skill-text">The very first interpreted language I chose to learn was JavaScript. I had experimented with HTML and CSS but wanted to add functionality to my pages. Through the course in Austin, DevBootcamp, and practice on my own, JavaScript has become one of my more comfortable languages. I love how adaptable it is, and how many frameworks use it. During my course at DevBootcamp, we practiced principles such as OOjs and the MVC pattern. I have used even Javascript in the <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser.io</a> game engine and the <a href="http://famo.us/">Famo.us</a> platform.</p>
      <p class="skill-text">
      After many hours practicing Ruby at DevBootcamp, it has become one of my favorite languages. Ruby made learning the fundamentals of object-oriented languages easier to understand. The syntax is very intuitive and there are many powerful built in methods and classes. We got plenty of practice using Ruby, in combination with Rails or Sinatra, to make CRUD apps, and much more. </p>

      <h2 class="skill-heading">Sinatra | Ruby on Rails</h2>
      <p class="skill-text">As part of the DevBootcamp curriculum we first learned the Sinatra framework and principles of Restful Routes. Then it was time for Ruby on Rails. We were able to see how much Rails could do for you right out of the box. I must say that I prefer the lighter weight of Sinatra for most of the work I have done so far. With Sinatra there seems to be more flexibility as you do not have to follow as many conventions. Both frameworks have their pros and cons.</p>

      <p class="skill-text">We started with the principles of SQL, learning how to create basic schema and insert data and query. PostgreSQL and SQLite were the first DBMS we used during the DevBootcamp curriculum. Writing the raw SQL queries was good practice for Active Record. Using Ruby with Active Record was tough to master as we got into advanced relations but it showed us just how powerful relational databases can be.</p>

      <h2 class="skill-heading">Node.js | MongoDB | Express </h2>
      <p class="skill-text">During our final project, we decided to try something new rather than go the conventional route using Ruby on Rails. DevBootcamp specializes in Rails but we wanted to use a framework that was new to us. We wrote our project with the 'MEAN' stack using Node.js for the backend, MongoDB for our database of users, Express to render the views, and Angular.js for front end elements. It was a very cool experience to dive into new technologies we had never used before. However, because of our previous practice with other frameworks, it was not that hard to get use to. Node is a platform I continue to use on many of my more recent projects to continue gaining experience.</p>

      <h2 class="skill-heading">Angular.js | Phaser.io</h2>
      <p class="skill-text">Angular.js is still a fairly newer technology to me. I have used it on a few projects, but it is a pretty robust framework and there is still much I could learn. I know how Angular can use JSON data, within controllers, to encapsulate behavior and render views. To continue practicing Angular I have used it on additional personal projects.</p>
      <p class="skill-text">Phaser.io was the game engine used in our final project. It was also brand new to us at the time, but with the relative complexity of our game, we got a lot of practice. Phaser is a great engine to get a 2D game up in running in a very short amount of time. We chose Phaser because of the popularity and support relative to other game engines out there. It proved to be a very good choice, allowing us to make a coding typing tutor with solid gameplay(<a href="http://codecrush.herokuapp.com/">Code Crush</a>).

      <p class="skill-text"> I was first introduced to Adobe InDesign in a high school computer class. I continued practicing with it over the years and have used it in the professional environment as well as personal projects. It is a great tool to format documents and other collateral. I have used Adobe Photoshop over the years, for basic photo editing. More recently, I took a few courses online on how to design page elements using Photoshop. Photoshop is also a very helpful wireframing tool. I am constantly using Photoshop on almost every major project I do for some purpose. </p>
