    <p class="about-text">I grew up in Wilmington, DE, just outside of Philadelphia, PA. I went to a small high school called Wilmington Friends School, a Quaker school. As far as programming goes, in middle school I started experimenting with Basic language on my TI-83 calculator. I made simple applications like homework loggers and a casino game but nothing too serious. In high school I started working with Visual Basic creating simple applications. I enjoyed math and science in high school and found myself naturally drawn towards programming.</p><p class="about-text">For college I made my way to Los Angeles to attend the University of Southern California. My major, Interactive Entertainment, was in the School of Cinematic Arts. It was mainly focused on video game design but also had elements of cinema and television as well. Many of my final projects involved designing actual video game programs. It was here where I realized I enjoy both the creative front-end aspect of design and the programming elements necessary to make an application.</p></div>

    <p class="about-text">After college I worked at Activision Publishing, the publishers for Call of Duty, as an intern on a new game called ‘Skylanders’. I enjoyed the experience, because it was valuable working in a dynamic environment like that, but I realized even before the internship that the video game world was not for me. Activision was also a tough company too work for because everyone was on pins and needles due to frequent layoffs. Not really what I thought the video game industry would be like…
    I then got into Real Estate as an Analyst for a startup real estate investment firm. The firm invested in apartment complexes all over California. I would create financial models in Microsoft Excel to show whether properties were looking at were good potential investments. I also had to do a wide variety of other tasks because it was such a small company. This was a great learning experience as well for this reason. I learned things from property accounting too developing a budget. However, after a year and a half the startup really wasn’t going anywhere I decided to part ways.</p>

I worked for another real estate firm as an analyst but with a different pay structure where I was commission based mainly. With the way the market was it was very hard for deals to go through because everything was too expensive. It was a sellers market and after a few months I saw no deals go through. I decided that it was time to take a chance in my career to do something else. I desired to do something more creative as real estate is a pretty cut and dry industry.
I started creating websites for family members using Squarespace.com to set up online stores for their artwork. The sites look great, feel free to check them out at Lisa-David.com and KristinaZallinger.com. I soon desired to make more custom sites where I could really design the layouts from scratch. I started using Lynda.com to teach myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Photoshop. As an experiment, I made my first site ClashOfClansCalculator.com around the popular iPhone game Clash of Clans. It was kind of ambitious but it proved to be worth it. I really enjoyed the entire process of designing a site from start to finish and this proved that I want to pursue this as a career.</p>

From there I have continued to practice by making additional site for myself and others. I know that in order to become a web developer I really need more experience. Teaching myself online using Lynda.com is great, but I really desire to be around others in classroom environment. Working on projects and discussing ideas is something I miss from my class at USC. I would love to be a part of your immersive program to learn the additional skills necessary to turn my love of web development into a career!

Personally, I love to stay active and explore the world around me. Some of the photos you see above are from trips to Germany, Isreal, Prague, and Colorado. I enjoy traveling but now it is time for me to focus on my career. To stay in shape I bike quite often around the city. When I'm not biking I golf, ski, play lacrosse, raquetball, and watch sports as well. I'm very partial to Philadelphia teams because I grew up in that area. I like to cook my own meals whenever I can, not just to save money but because I enjoy creating a all kinds of dishes. Creating is a part of so many aspects of my life even outside of web development</p>
