I started working for Tesla last February. I wanted a part time job, so I could focus on web development, and have been a huge fan of Tesla ever since the release of their Model S. They started me off really quickly because they were extremely short staffed so I was really thrown into the mix. The training that was supposed to last a week was more like three days before I was talking to customers on the floor. My very first week was a Test Drive event as well so extra hours were required with training. I worked a total of 67 hours my first week working there! So much for a part time job!

However, I really cannot complain because for the most part it is a pretty chill job. Most of the time it is not too busy and job mainly entails educating people on what exactly Tesla is and how our electric car works. The car really sells itself because it is so much better than any other full electric option out there. We are there to answer any questions people might have because it is such a new technology many people have questions. They prepare us to answer the common questions with tools like touchscreens and iPads to access the website and other apps. Many people ask the same questions so you begin to have prepared responses for most of the things people could ask. There are always those questions that I have never heard before though that I have to consult with other people in the store. You are constantly learning at Tesla. I have learned more about electricity and cars than I thought I would ever know.

Although working for Tesla is great, and I strongly believe in what the company is doing, I am not sure I would want to pursue a career working there. I am not sure I would want to work in sales. Also, I see that position my managers are in and I am not sure I would want that. You really have to be passionate about Tesla, and be in it for the long haul knowing you are going to make some sacrifices now while the company is growing. If Tesla were to higher me as web developer after school, then that is another story.
