One of my favorite bike trails here in Austin is Walnut Creek Trail, starting off of Jain Lane. It's on the east side of town but is still relatively close to downtown. The trail is about 10-12 miles of paved bike trails going through the woods and some parks out there. Not to mention it is a great being able to bike without having to worry about cars or pedestrians. The trail is relatively flat but does have a few areas with steep declines. I enjoy riding my road bike, and more recently my fixed gear bike, on this trail.

The other day I was biking Walnut Creek after the most recent rainstorm. The trail was in pretty good condition for the most part because it is a paved road. However, mud had washed up on a few areas creating "mud pits" in the middle of the road. There was one especially bad mud pit under this one bridge at the bottom of a steep hill. Blinded by a sharp corner, there was no warning for this pile of mud so I had no choice but to go right into it. The bridge in the underpass also had a tree that had fallen over from the storm. It was quite the obstacle, and I could not believe I had to run into it with my new bike. 

Stopping on the fixed gear bikes is tough and I am still learning how to do it more quickly. I ended up going under the tree but smacking my helmet on the bottom of it causing it to hit my nose. Not a big deal though, I was more upset about how dirty my bike got! I am really starting to enjoy riding the fixed gear as I get more use to it.
