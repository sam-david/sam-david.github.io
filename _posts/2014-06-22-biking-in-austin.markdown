Cycling around Austin is very different from Los Angeles. In Los Angeles there were not too many routes in the area to bike on the road. The city is made for cars to get around, but not necessarily bikes. My main route was to bike down to the beach and go along the bike path they have built into the beach there from Santa Monica to Palos Verdes (about 20 miles long).  It was amazing being able to bike on the beach, however, it was very crowded and required a lot of people dodging. I also mountain biked frequently with my cousin in the Santa Monica mountains. There was one short loop, with a bunch of whoops, that he loved we would go to. Mountain biking was harder for me in the city as I was not in good shape. My cousin is the main reason that I got back into biking and I am very thankful for that. 

When I moved to Austin I knew I was going to have a lot more options for bike routes. I started mountain biking around town lake and have found other road routes like Shoal Creek blvd and even the 360. The town lake is a nice shorter route that I can do in about an hour or so. I frequently do this before work or on days I know I do not have as much time.

After saving up for quite some time, I saved up to purchase a new road bike. For the past year, I have been using a hybrid bike, which is much heavier and not quite is good for longer rides. I decided it was time to pull the trigger and purchase a new road bike. I have had it for a couple weeks now but love the difference so far. Some of my favorite routes to go on around here are Shoal Creek Blvd and the 360. I tried the 360 for the very first time with this bike and reached a large hill where I was able to go 45 mph! Check out this route map to see my max speed on that trip. Up until then, I had never gone any faster than 35 mph so this was a very wild experience.
