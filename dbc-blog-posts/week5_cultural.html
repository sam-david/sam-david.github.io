      <p class="blogcontent">When I first heard of pairing via Google Hangouts, I was a little skeptical as to how effective it would be to work with someone in this way. It is clear to me now though, with Google Hangout and Stypi we are able to pretty easily collaborate on a single Ruby doc at one time. I do wish there was a way to preview Ruby right from Stypi! So far pairing has been really effective for me in learning alternative ways of creating code. It is cool to see the different ways people think and solve problems.</p>
      <p class="blogcontent">
      Also, having the ability to talk through something with someone really helps to figure out exactly what a program is doing or how you are going to solve a problem. The most effective sessions I have had so far have been the ones where we can bounce ideas off eachother constantly to complete the exercises. I really enjoyed some of my GPS sessions where you have a third person there acting as a very hands off advisor. I liked being able to work along with my partner but having the recent graduate there to help us when we were off track or if they could see a better way of doing something.</p>
      <p class="blogcontent">
      One GPS session I had early on was particularly enjoyable to me. In this exercise we were supposed to create a simple webpage with HTML and CSS. My partner and I were constantly throwing design ideas of eachother. We ended up with a very simple, but I think well done page. I also learned a few different CSS techniques from the way he did things. I think that is what I have liked most about the pairing sessions so far. When you pair program and see how others code, you can learn many new and efficient ways to do things. We often get stuck in our particular ways to do things in programing so I think it always useful to see alternative perspectives. </p>
      <p class="blogcontent">
        It was interesting reading my feedback so far. It seems mostly positive which I was glad to see. It was helpful to see some things people liked and thought I could improve. People liked that I enjoy 'spitballing' ideas with them. I think people also appreciated the fact that I often talked about things other than pairing before we started. Just as simple as asking people how they are doing. I think the only thing that stood of as an area of improvement was in one particular exercise niether one of us did the greatest job at figuring out what the original code was doing and how we could restructure it. We ended up finishing the exercise but it took a little longer than usual. I think overall the feedback was positive so I am very pleased!
